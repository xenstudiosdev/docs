# Installation

Let's get started with creating your first Eternity Project:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Installing the package">
    Before generating a project, you need to install the package first. Choose one of the below to your liking and install Eternity:

    <CodeGroup>

    ``` NPM
    npm install --location=global eternity.js
    ```

    
    ``` Yarn
    yarn global add eternity.js
    ```

    
    ``` PNPM
    pnpm add -g eternity.js
    ```

    
    ``` Bun
    bun add -g eternity.js
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate installation">
    After running the command, run the version command to validate the installation:

    ```
    eternity --version
    ```

    This should display the version of eternity
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate a new project">
    Generating a project is easy, with our CLI it should automatically do it for you. Use:

    ```
    eternity new
    ```

    to generate a new project, it'll ask you questions about the project before fully setting it up.

    After installing and finishing everything, your project should be set up. With your command manager, you can use scripts like:

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Start Script" icon="sparkles">
        Starts the project, not in development mode.
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Development" icon="sparkles">
        Starts the project in development mode, tied to one server for testing.

        - If a database is connected to this, it'll use a development sqlite database so it doesnt alter your production database.
